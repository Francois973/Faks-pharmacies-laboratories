# Faks

This API allows to gather two types of establishments, both pharmacies and laboratories. It allows to create interactions between laboratories that provide products to partner pharmacies for example: orders from laboratories and sales of products by pharmacies. Also, the user of this API will be able to have information about the pharmacies that make the most sales and the cities where they are located. 

Finally, the API will automatically send an email to pharmacies and laboratories in case of low stock (quantity: less than 5).
